# Foundry File Helper

**Foundry File Helper** is a VSCode extension specifically designed for Solidity developers to automatically generate file templates that conform to the Foundry project structure. This extension monitors the `.sol` files in the `src` directory and automatically creates corresponding deployment scripts and test files in the `script` and `test` directories.

## Features

- **Foundry Compatibility**: The extension is tailored for Foundry projects, ensuring that the generated files follow the Foundry structure standards.
- **Streamlined Development**: Focus on coding by reducing the overhead of managing project files.
